# Which workflow proposals are still waiting for the owner to apply them.
#
# The agent building this repository holds a token without the `Workflows`
# permission, so it cannot write `.github/workflows/` at all — a push carrying one
# of those paths is rejected before any review happens. Changes to CI are
# therefore written to ci/proposed/ and applied by the owner; ci/proposed/README.md
# is the contract.
#
# The failure that convention invites is a proposal nobody notices, so this
# reports the state rather than leaving it to be remembered. It is not a gate:
# a pending proposal is a normal state, and failing CI on one would mean CI going
# red for a change that has not been asked for yet.
#
# Usage: scripts/workflow-proposals.sh

# A proposal is applied by copying it, and a copy that goes through an editor
# rather than `cp` routinely loses its trailing newline. That is not a change to
# the workflow, but a byte-for-byte comparison calls it one — and a report that
# cries pending on an applied proposal is a report people stop reading, which is
# the failure this repository has already had once with the link gate.
#
# So trailing newlines are normalised and nothing else is. Whitespace inside a
# YAML file is not incidental, and the whole point of the comparison is that the
# live workflow is the file that was reviewed.
#
# Command substitution strips trailing newlines from both sides, which is the
# whole normalisation — no sed, no temporary files.
